# Yin and Yang of Haskell

This repository contains the material needed to follow the *Yin and Yang of Haskell* workshop in LambdaWorld CÃ¡diz 2019.

## Pre-workshop

1. Read [*Fast and Furious Intro to Haskell*](https://github.com/47deg/yin-yang-haskell-workshop/tree/master/0-pre-workshop/fast-furious-intro.md). This small tutorial teaches the minimal amount of syntax you need to know in order to understand simple Haskell code.

2. Try to do the [pre-workshop exercise](https://github.com/47deg/yin-yang-haskell-workshop/tree/master/0-pre-workshop/game-exercise/README.md). You can practice your Haskell skills and ensure that the environment is set up.


## In the workshop

Each folder contains one of the exercises to do. Most of the files are thought to be executed using `runghc`.
